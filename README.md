Apple Data Privacy  <br />

Example 2: [Flock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rMV6N4Pl-Y)  <br />
Example 3: [Tracked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjf7c-O5GyQ&t=1s)  <br />
While most consumers claim to value data privacy, the fine print of social media EULAs often leads them to share more than they realize. Even when they do realize, privacy can still feel abstract; out of sight, out of mind. Apple excels at making it tangible, visually illustrating what lack of control entails. The animated Apple lock logo is also a standout example of design.  <br />

[Lipton Milk Tea 667 Love Letters](https://www.dentsucreative.com/en-gb/cases/667-love-letters) - Created by [Dentsu Inc. Japan](https://www.dentsucreative.com/en-gb/location/japan/japan), simply a work of art. <br />

[SATO 2531](https://www.oneclub.org/awards/oneasia/-award/55475/sato-2531/) - An amazing example of the power of data when communicated effectively to its target audience. Japan was the only country that legally required married couples to share a last name, yet the public was largely unaware of the implications. Asuniwa partnered with a university professor to simulate the impact and with Dentsu Digital Inc. Tokyo to convey the findings. The campaign sparked an organic, incredibly powerful social movement and successfully shifted public opinion in favor of allowing separate last names. <br />
